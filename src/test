As per mail logs- 2018-04-16 11:19:50 1f82Ao-003suU-3c => blackhole (non-SMTP ACL discarded recipients): "Email ID is not registered by the user through cPanel plugin (From address: "Surgician" <no-reply@surgician.com>, User: surgicg9)" The issue is that the email ID is not registered in cpanel plugin, which is a server requirement. Go to Cpanel > Mails > register email and add no-reply@surgician.com there AND every domain email ID that is used in mail script needs to be added there After adding wait for 1-2 hours, mails will work fine
It is a server requirement that either one of the two- From or TO email ID in the mail script should be a domain specific email ID and so make use of it and see if it works for you This is a restriction set on our servers recently to avoid any kind of abuse of server such as spamming, etc as we have noticed in the past and that is why it is important to use a domain email address for the email functionality to work
Because this is the new feature enabled in cPAnel, called "Registered Mail IDs". And if there is any contact form/mail script in your website,You will have to register the email ID used in the mail script as registered using the "Registered Mail IDs" option on your cpanel.
